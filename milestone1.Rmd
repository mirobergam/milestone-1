The paper I am considering replicating is called "The future of death in
America". This paper uses newly availible health and demographic data to make
predictions about mortality, incorporating factors like obesity and tobacco
consumption. The conclusions it draws about the average age of death for men and
women is important, the paper says, for "allocating public health expenditures,
setting research priorities, and evaluating the viability of public and private
pensions, and health care financing systems." The paper is co-authored by Gary
King, meaning the data is likely easy to access.
